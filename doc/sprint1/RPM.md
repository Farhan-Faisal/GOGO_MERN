# GOGO

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: 06/06/2023
 * End date: 15/06/2023

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

We expect everyone in the team to be full-stack developers.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

 We will meet on 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th of June for online standup(15 minute meeting) at 9pm. The
 purpose of the meeting is to discuss progress, what to do next, identify blockers and keep the team informed.

 We are not planning on having any other meeting but if a team member is blocked on an issue and needs help, at least some members of the team will schedule a coding session to help the blocked team member.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

We will use Jira for project management. 
We will discuss prioritises and assign tasks to team members in the planning meeting on Jira. Then team members can move the user stories/tasks to the appropriate stage so that everyone can track progress.


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Our goal is to demo a minimum vialbilty product by the end of the sprint. We will do our best to complete the following user stories ordered from most to less important:

* â€‹As a registered user, I want a login page so that I can access my account using my login credentials.

* As a registered GOGO user, I want a dashboard which will show me events based on my interests so that I can find events I am interested in easily and in an expedient manner.

* As an unregistered user, I want to register on the GOGO website using my email address so that I can create, attend and/or view events.

* As a logged-in user, I want to edit my interests so that other users are aware of my latest interests.

* As a logged-in user, I want to add simple events on the website so that I can go to events with like-minded individuals.

* As a logged-in user, I want to edit my user biography so that other users get to read my latest details.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

We will make the following webpages take from the mock-up in https://www.figma.com/file/phjEUkJow2olEZBOrIVRqh/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=SyVpQ6LbgeqBP2tt-0 :

* Login page
Login page will allow the user to login. Without this feature, users cannot securely add events/invite people.

* Sign-up page
Sign-up page will allow users to regsiter their account using their email. Without this users will not be able to login without us manually entering their credentials in the database.

* Events dashboard
Event dashboard will be the landing page for users after they login. This page will let them see events and navigate to other pages in the website.

* Account page
The account page will let users view, edit their profile and interests to best match them.
