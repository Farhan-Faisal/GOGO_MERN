# GOGO

## Iteration 01

- Start date: 06/06/2023
- End date: 15/06/2023

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

We expect everyone on the team to be full-stack developers.

#### Events

We will meet on the 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, and 16th of June for online standup(15-minute meeting) at 9 pm. The
purpose of the meeting is to discuss progress, what to do next, identify blockers, and keep the team informed.

We are not planning on having any other meeting but if a team member is blocked on an issue and needs help, at least some members of the team will schedule a coding session to help the blocked team member.

#### Artifacts

We will use Jira for project management.
We will discuss priorities and assign tasks to team members in the planning meeting on Jira. Then team members can move the user stories/tasks to the appropriate stage so that everyone can track progress.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

Our goal is to demo a minimum viability product by the end of the sprint. We will do our best to complete the following user stories ordered from most to less important:

- â€‹As a registered user, I want a login page so that I can access my account using my login credentials.

- As a registered GOGO user, I want a dashboard that will show me events based on my interests so that I can find events I am interested in easily and in an expedient manner.

- As an unregistered user, I want to register on the GOGO website using my email address so that I can create, attend and/or view events.

- As a logged-in user, I want to edit my interests so that other users are aware of my latest interests.

- As a logged-in user, I want to add simple events on the website so that I can go to events with like-minded individuals.

- As a logged-in user, I want to edit my user biography so that other users get to read my latest details.

#### Artifacts

We will make the following webpages taken from the mock-up in https://www.figma.com/file/phjEUkJow2olEZBOrIVRqh/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=SyVpQ6LbgeqBP2tt-0 :

- Login page
  The login page will allow the user to log in. Without this feature, users cannot securely add events/invite people.

- Sign-up page
  The sign-up page will allow users to register their accounts using their email. Without this users will not be able to log in without us manually entering their credentials in the database.

- Events Dashboard
  The event dashboard will be the landing page for users after they log in. This page will let them see events and navigate to other pages on the website.

- Account page
  The account page will let users view, and edit their profile and interests to best match them.
