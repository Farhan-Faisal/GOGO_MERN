## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 09/07/2023
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

We believe we achieved most of our goals for sprint 2, and we are happy with the work we completed. However, we believe a few more process changes will make our future collaboration more effective.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 - We believe our decision to conduct standup meetings once every two days continues to be successful since it gives team members the time to report substantial work to the team. It allows us to seek help to clear blockers at the appropriate time.
 - We believe our decision to note down action items after the end of each meeting helped team members keep track of the work they needed to do before the next meeting.
 - We believe our decision to post and follow the practices mentioned in the "Industry-standard" channel led to more consistent coding practices and more readable code.
 - We believe our agreement to work only on tasks related to the Jira linked to the branch led to fewer merge conflicts and smoother teamwork.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


- We did not properly map out dependencies and timelines to complete user stories which led to team members not being able to start on dependent user stories.
- We did not thoroughly discuss the scope of user stories we agreed to work on. This led to duplication of work and last-minute confusion.
- We did not discuss changes made to MongoDB schemas with the team. This led to duplicate schemas and confusion regarding the purpose of schemas.

#### Planned changes

- We will thoroughly discuss the scopes of the user stories before we assign team members to them and start working on them. This will minimize the chances of duplicate work being done by the team.
- We will map out dependencies and chart a timeline of completion so that all user stories can be completed within the deadline. 
- We will adopt the planning poker technique to estimate story points so that all team members are on the same page regarding the complexity of each user story.
- When possible, we will attempt to select user stories that minimize dependencies. This will ensure that team members can complete as much work as possible simultaneously.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

We completed the following user stories:
 - As a logged-in user, I want to send invites to other people to accompany me to an event listed on the app so that I have a buddy to attend the event with.[MODIFIED]

 - As a logged-in user interested in attending an event, I want to see all the events I requested to attend so that I can track my requests better.

 - As a logged-in user, I want to see the events I created so that I can better manage my events.

 - As a logged-in user, I want to edit my profile picture so that other users get to see my latest pictures. 

 - As a logged-in user, I want to chat with the user I accepted to go to the event with so that I can communicate with them.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 - We were not able to complete the user story with the description, "As a logged-in user, I want to be able to accept or reject an invitation so that I can notify the requesting user of my choice." We were not able to complete it because of nested dependencies, which caused us to run out of time before we could get to it.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- We will refine the scope of user stories by discussing them with team members before we start working on them. 
- We will chart a path of completion along with a timeline before we start the sprint so that team members have a reasonable path toward achieving sprint goals.
- We will update the design document to reflect the changes we make to the product so that team members and other stakeholders have visibility into the work being done.
- We will discuss changes we make to schemas before we commit them to "develop" and ensure that the team is aware of the purpose of the changes.
