Given the invited user is logged in, when the invite-sending user checks the onMe feature and sends the invitation, then the invitee should see that the inviter is willing to pay.


## User Story 23

As a business, I want to be able to see how many people accepted my promoters’ invitations to my event, so that I know how many additional attendees to expect.

Given a business that has posted an event with promoters, when they navigate to the promoters dashboard, then they can see the number of people each promoter has gotten to attend.


## User Story 24

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to accept or reject a “promoter” status invitation from a business for an event, so that I can invite people on behalf of the business.

Given a business sends a “promoter” status invitation, when the invited user receives the invitation, then the user can choose “Accept” or “Reject”.
