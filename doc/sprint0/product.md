# GOGO

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

GoGo is a website that connects individuals who want to explore events and experiences together while providing a platform for businesses to expand their reach.

* From a consumer perspective, GoGo helps overcome the anxiety of attending events alone, empowering them to venture beyond their comfort zone to create lasting memories and meaningful connections with kindred spirits. Through GoGo, users can post about events, invite people with similar interests to accompany them to the event and create a memorable event experience together.

* From a business perspective, consumers often skip out on experiences being hesitant to go to events alone, resulting in missed opportunities for both consumers and businesses. By connecting these individuals, GoGo enables businesses to tap into an otherwise untapped user base. Additionally, GoGo provides businesses the valuable ability to incentivize customers to bring more people with them by giving special discounts to users who bring a certain number of event companions. This feature will increase audience turnout, generating more revenue for businesses and create a lively atmosphere for all participants.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

 GoGo's target users can be broadly categorized into two:
 * Individuals who experience anxiety or discomfort attending events alone or are simply looking for people to go with. For example, 
 Garry: [https://perfectstrangers.xtensio.com/edit/3cywm27q](url)
 Amelia: [https://whydoihavetomakethis.xtensio.com/pca604rl](url)
 
 * Businesses organising events that want to tap into a larger market by connecting individuals who would otherwise skip out on experiences due to the anxiety of attending alone. For example,

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

We describe why users would choose our product by comparing it with the alternatives that users use today to solve their problem:
* MeetUp <br />
Meetup allows users to post events/activities on the app and join groups of people who are interested in particular events/activities. However, it does not allow a user to connect with another user through event invitations, and have one-on-one interactions with them regarding the event. GoGo allows this one-one interaction between users enabling them to get acquainted prior to the event. This is especially beneficial for someone who does not like group settings. Additionally, users of MeetUp have to wait for a group to be formed whereas on GoGo users can attend events as soon as at least two are ready to go to the event.


* EventBrite<br />
EventBrite allows users to sign up for events going on around them. It also allows them to post their own events on the application. But it does not allow users to see potential people who would be interested in joining them at the event. Addtionally, it does not allow users to interact with other users interested in the event through the app. GoGo solves this issue by showing users profiles of other users (which includes the person's interests) enabling them to an informed choice by vetting the requesting individual's profile.

* Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Tinder <br />
Social media sites do not make the events/experience the center of focus in the user-user interaction. In social media platforms, users connect with others based on their personalities. But sometimes, we might not like the personality or quirks of a person but may enjoy their company greatly during a certain activity. By making the event/activity/experience the focus of the user-user interaction, GoGo allows users to meet with such people as well whose company they might enjoy only during the event/activity/experience.
The profiles of users are not validated in most social media sites (unlike GoGo) which makes them more prone to scams and less secure.

#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 

We will consider a user story to be done when it has been programmed by the assigned team member and reviewed by two reviewers (assigned for that user story) from the team.


### Highlights

Here are the key decisions and/or insights that came up during our meetings:

 * We decided to meet 3 times a week on Zoom to discuss everyone's progress. An alternative was to meet in person but Zoom was chosen as most of our availabilities match up at night and an online meetup would be more appropriate at that time. Additionally, Zoom enables screen sharing which is more convenient for a 6 person team to go over a team member's progress report. An argument for an in-person meeting would be that it allows team members to debug each other's problems faster. Hence, we also reserved a potential in-person meet-up time which would be used if a team member faces a significant problem (eg. a tricky bug).

 * We decided on making a web application for the product. An alternative was to make a Mobile App which would make accessing the product very convenient for the user. But a web app was chosen as its usage would not be limited to the MobileOS the user has.

 * We decided to use the MERN stack since the MERN stack is a widely popular tech stack with lots of tutorials and documentation that would make it easy for us to get ramped up quickly. Additionally, it has a strong developer community and a wealth of resources to solve commonly encountered issues during development. The MEAN stack was considered as an alternative but it uses AngularJs not React. We will learn React in class so by using MERN stack over MEAN, we are avoiding the overhead of learning a second framework and ensuring that we have adequate support and guidance from the teaching staff.

 * For our product choice, we considered Rapid RESERVE, LIME, Ascend, and ideas from individual team members. We chose not to proceed with Rapid RESERVE because we found that users had strong, well-established alternatives to choose from. We decided against Ascend presented because we considered it impractical to implement in a course project setting. Firstly, we would need to license any movie/show that we want to show users. This is an expensive and time-consuming process. Additionally, hosting massively movies/shows takes a lot of bandwidth and storage space all of which will add to the expense. Team members discussed other alternatives like messaging platform for UofT students with course spaces, a course management app for students, making a better UTSC Job portal, an E-commerce site, etc, but we decided to do Lime since we believed that it solves a problem that cannot be solved using the tools that exist today. Additionally, we believe in the core mission of helping to connect individuals who want to explore events and experiences.
